## General info
This project is a personal blog site. The main objectives of this project was to create a well-designed, user friendly blogging site. User experience was kept in mind during the design of the project. 

React concepts such as React Hooks, props, JSX, React Router, React components, map (more like es6 JS concept) were used throughout the project. Also, prettier was used to factor the code for better understandability and easier readibility.

(This is just a frontend website with missing backend. Hence, some functionalities are not completed. They are mentioned below)


## Work Completed
This porject is only a front-end design of a blogging site. The front-end design was completed using React.Js. A proper backend API needs to be developed and implemented withinh the porject to perform additional functionalities.
Currently, the blog site is able to:
* Display a header menu with links to various pages and components within the website.
*  Display a list of blogs in the homepage.
* Search blogs by category (eg. photography, food, lifestyle).
* Add new blogs along with their category. These blogs can are displayed in the browser once added. (Stored temporarily)
* Display a well-designed, responsive login and signup pages for user registration and login.
*  Display a settings page by cliclking on the user image on the header menu. 
*  Routing between various pages and components is achoeved using React Router v6.

The enhancements that can be performed to the project are:
* Create a proper backend for the project using Node.JS for handling data. (Lack of such backend API prevents implementation of functionalities).
* Even though there are buttons to edit and delete blogs within the blog component, they have no functionality. 
* About and contact pages are not yet designed.
